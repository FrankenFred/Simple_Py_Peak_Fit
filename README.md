# Simple_Py_Peak_Fit
Simple Python 3 script that reads in a spectrum and uses HITRAN line data to perform a Voight profile NLLSQ fit (with offset). Change line, experimental and file properties as needed. Available in Jupyter notebook and .py format.

## Version 0:
Preliminary version shows fitting capability and is hard coded to:
* Fit a single line in the MIR (used experimentally)
* Only fits in the Absorption/wavenumber domain
